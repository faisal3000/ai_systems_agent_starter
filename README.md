# AI Systems Engineering Agent – Starter Kit

This repository contains a clean, minimal version of the platform (FastAPI backend + Next.js 15 static frontend) ready to be connected to Wix Dev Mode via GitHub.

## Structure
* `backend/` – FastAPI service (JWT auth, admin approval, NASA + OpenAI integration, Redis rate‑limiter).
* `frontend/` – Next.js 15 app configured for `output: 'export'` so Wix can serve the static files.

See individual READMEs in each directory.
